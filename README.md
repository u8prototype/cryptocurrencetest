Creating a didatic crypto currence

It's works But in last line when test mine funciton use 1 to difficult to test.
If you put 2 it will take so long!

But all the principles are in this script

By the way it don't have P2P data or some nodes...

It's just a prototype for understand the basic's of Crypto Currence

* Use Execute.py to see all of test's I did in sequence
* Need install all lib with pip3
* It use python 3.6

Thanks.
